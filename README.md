Javascript Calculator, I cheated a bit with the evalStringArray, as I'm still not super good with using it, but making some progress with it and array's in general.

This project ended up a bit easier than I thought it would be because of learning how to better manipulate the DOM, and the evalStringArray for the math. 

Clearing the display and having another variable there to save the previously shown number took me a while to figure out but it came together eventually.

Updating the display/displayNum and or resetting it back to 0 was probably the most tedious addition to the program It took me a while to realize all the places I was going to need to do this at. Just when you think it's done there's another spot you find where you're just getting 300 numbers and it's not updating properly.

Need to test for bugs still, But I believe this is a finished project.
